The Elastic Load Balancer provides a feature called sticky session which binds the user\u2019s session with a specific EC2 instance. If the sticky session is enabled the first request from the user will be redirected to any of the EC2 instances. But, henceforth, all requests from the same user will be redirected to the same EC2 instance. This ensures that all requests coming from the user during the session will be sent to the same application instance.       ",

To avoid this as well as achieve the best performance it is required to pre warm the EBS volume. For a volume created from a snapshot and attached with a Linux OS, the \u201cdd\u201d command pre warms the existing data on EBS and any restored snapshots of volumes that have been previously fully pre warmed. This command maintains incremental snapshots; however, because this operation is read-only, it does not pre warm unused space that has never been written to on the original volume. In the command \u201cdd if=/dev/xvdf of=/dev/null bs=1M\u201d , the parameter \u201cif=input file\u201d should be set to the drive that the user wishes to warm. The \u201cof=output file\u201d parameter should be set to the Linux null virtual device, /dev/null. The \u201cbs\u201d parameter sets the block size of the read operation; for optimal performance, this should be set to 1 MB.       ",

        "correctAnswer": "C",
        "explain": "Explanation: Failover Process for Amazon RDS: In the event of a planned or unplanned outage of your DB instance, Amazon RDS automatically switches to a standby replica in another Availability Zone if you have enabled Multi-AZ. The time it takes for the failover to complete depends on the database activity and other conditions at the time the primary DB instance became unavailable. The failover mechanism automatically changes the DNS record of the DB instance to point to the standby DB instance. As a result, you will need to re- establish any existing connections to your DB instance.

        "explain": "Explanation: There are two opportunities for a copy request to return an error. One can occur when Amazon S3 receives the copy request and the other can occur while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy operation starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the 200 OK response. This means that a 200 OK response can contain either a success or an error. Make sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. If the copy is successful, you receive a response that contains the information about the copied object.       ",

Decoupling the components of an application -you have a queue of work items and want to track the successful completion of each item independently. Amazon SQS tracks the ACK/FAIL results, so the application does not have to maintain a persistent checkpoint or cursor. After a configured visibility timeout, Amazon SQS deletes acknowledged messages and redelivers failed messages.

With standard queues, you can configure individual messages to have a delay of up to 15 minutes. Dynamically increasing concurrency or throughput at read time -you have a work queue and want to add more consumers until the backlog is cleared. Amazon SQS requires no pre-provisioning.

        "explain": "Explanation: Cryptographic best practices discourage extensive reuse of encryption keys. To create new cryptographic material for your AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master keys (CMKs), you can create new CMKs, and then change your applications or aliases to use the new CMKs. Or, you can enable automatic key rotation for an existing CMK.   When you enable automatic key rotation for a customer managed CMK, AWS KMS generates new cryptographic material for the CMK every year. AWS KMS also saves the CMK's older cryptographic material in perpetuity so it can be used to decrypt data that it encrypted. AWS KMS does not delete any rotated key material until you delete the CMK. Reference: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html>       ",

CloudTrail log file integrity validation uses industry standard algorithms: SHA-256 for hashing and SHA256 with RSA for digital signing. This makes it computationally unfeasible to modify, delete or forge CloudTrail log files without detection. T Configuring multi-factor authentication (MFA) ensures that any attempt to change the versioning state of your bucket or permanently delete an object version requires additional authentication. This helps prevent any operation that could compromise the integrity of your log files, even if a user acquires the password of an IAM user that has permissions to permanently delete Amazon S3 objects.
