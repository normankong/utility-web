        },
        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "explain": "Explanation: Active-passive failover   Use an active-passive failover configuration when you want a primary resource or group of resources to be available the majority of the time and you want a secondary resource or group of resources to be on standby in case all the primary resources become unavailable. When responding to queries, Route 53 includes only the healthy primary resources. If all the primary resources are unhealthy, Route 53 begins to include only the healthy secondary resources in response to DNS queries.   To create an active-passive failover configuration with one primary record and one secondary record, you just create the records and specify Failover for the routing policy. When the primary resource is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries using the primary record. When the primary resource is unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries using the secondary record.   How Amazon Route 53 averts cascading failures   As a first defense against cascading failures, each request routing algorithm (such as weighted and failover) has a mode of last resort. In this special mode, when all records are considered unhealthy, the Route 53 algorithm reverts to considering all records healthy.   For example, if all instances of an application, on several hosts, are rejecting health check requests, Route 53 DNS servers will choose an answer anyway and return it rather than returning no DNS answer or returning an NXDOMAIN (non-existent domain) response. An application can respond to users but still fail health checks, so this provides some protection against misconfiguration.   Similarly, if an application is overloaded, and one out of three endpoints fails its health checks, so that it's excluded from Route 53 DNS responses, Route 53 distributes responses between the two remaining endpoints. If the remaining endpoints are unable to handle the additional load and they fail, Route 53 reverts to distributing requests to all three endpoints.

        "explain": "Explanation: Amazon RDS Read Replicas   Amazon RDS Read Replicas provide enhanced performance and durability for RDS database (DB) instances. They make it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads. You can create one or more replicas of a given source DB Instance and serve high-volume application read traffic from multiple copies of your data, thereby increasing aggregate read throughput. Read replicas can also be promoted when needed to become standalone DB instances. Read replicas are available in Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server as well as Amazon Aurora.   For the MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server database engines, Amazon RDS creates a second DB instance using a snapshot of the source DB instance. It then uses the engines' native asynchronous replication to update the read replica whenever there is a change to the source DB instance. The read replica operates as a DB instance that allows only read-only connections; applications can connect to a read replica just as they would to any DB instance. Amazon RDS replicates all databases in the source DB instance.   Amazon Aurora further extends the benefits of read replicas by employing an SSD-backed virtualized storage layer purpose-built for database workloads. Amazon Aurora replicas share the same underlying storage as the source instance, lowering costs and avoiding the need to copy data to the replica nodes. For more information about replication with Amazon Aurora, see the online documentation.   ![](https://exampracticetests.com/aws/Solutions_Architect- Associate_SAA-C02/wp-content/uploads/exam/_Page_006_Image_0001.jpg)   Reference: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRep\u2026](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html 'External link') <https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/read-replicas/>       ",

You can use any method that is supported by Amazon S3 to get your objects into Amazon S3, for example, the Amazon S3 console or API, or a third-party tool. You can create a hierarchy in your bucket to store the objects, just as you would with any other Amazon S3 bucket.   Using an existing Amazon S3 bucket as your CloudFront origin server doesn't change the bucket in any way; you can still use it as you normally would to store and access Amazon S3 objects at the standard Amazon S3 price. You incur regular Amazon S3 charges for storing the objects in the bucket.   Using Amazon S3 Buckets Configured as Website Endpoints for Your Origin   You can set up an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a website endpoint as custom origin with CloudFront.   When you configure your CloudFront distribution, for the origin, enter the Amazon S3 static website hosting endpoint for your bucket. This value appears in the Amazon S3 console, on the Properties tab, in the Static website hosting pane. For example: <http://bucket-name.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com>   For more information about specifying Amazon S3 static website endpoints, see Website endpoints in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.   When you specify the bucket name in this format as your origin, you can use Amazon S3 redirects and Amazon S3 custom error documents.

AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time you consume \u2013 there is no charge when your code is not running. With AWS Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service \u2013 all with zero administration. AWS Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. All you need to do is supply your code in one of the languages that AWS Lambda supports.   Storing your static content with S3 provides a lot of advantages. But to help optimize your application\u2019s performance and security while effectively managing cost, we recommend that you also set up Amazon CloudFront to work with your S3 bucket to serve and protect the content. CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that delivers static and dynamic web content, video streams, and APIs around the world, securely and at scale. By design, delivering data out of CloudFront can be more cost effective than delivering it from S3 directly to your users.   CloudFront serves content through a worldwide network of data centers called Edge Locations.

        "explain": "Explanation: Amazon RDS uses the MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server DB engines' built-in replication functionality to create a special type of DB instance called a read replica from a source DB instance. Updates made to the source DB instance are asynchronously copied to the read replica. You can reduce the load on your source DB instance by routing read queries from your applications to the read replica.   When you create a read replica, you first specify an existing DB instance as the source. Then Amazon RDS takes a snapshot of the source instance and creates a read-only instance from the snapshot. Amazon RDS then uses the asynchronous replication method for the DB engine to update the read replica whenever there is a change to the source DB instance. The read replica operates as a DB instance that allows only read-only connections. Applications connect to a read replica the same way they do to any DB instance. Amazon RDS replicates all databases in the source DB instance.

In addition, last month we made a significant reduction (26% to 83%) in the cost of transferring data between AWS Regions, making it less expensive to operate in more than one AWS region.   Today we are introducing a new feature: Amazon Machine Image (AMI) Copy. AMI Copy enables you to easily copy your Amazon Machine Images between AWS Regions. AMI Copy helps enable several key scenarios including:   Simple and Consistent Multi-Region Deployment \u2013 You can copy an AMI from one region to another, enabling you to easily launch consistent instances based on the same AMI into different regions.   Scalability \u2013 You can more easily design and build world-scale applications that meet the needs of your users, regardless of their location.   Performance \u2013 You can increase performance by distributing your application and locating critical components of your application in closer proximity to your users. You can also take advantage of region-specific features such as instance types or other AWS services.   Even Higher Availability \u2013 You can design and deploy applications across AWS regions, to increase availability.   Once the new AMI is in an Available state the copy is complete.

        "explain": "Explanation: Network Load Balancer overview   A Network Load Balancer functions at the fourth layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It can handle millions of requests per second. After the load balancer receives a connection request, it selects a target from the target group for the default rule. It attempts to open a TCP connection to the selected target on the port specified in the listener configuration.   When you enable an Availability Zone for the load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing creates a load balancer node in the Availability Zone. By default, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in its Availability Zone only. If you enable cross-zone load balancing, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in all enabled Availability Zones. For more information, see Availability Zones.   If you enable multiple Availability Zones for your load balancer and ensure that each target group has at least one target in each enabled Availability Zone, this increases the fault tolerance of your applications. For example, if one or more target groups does not have a healthy target in an Availability Zone, we remove the IP address for the corresponding subnet from DNS, but the load balancer nodes in the other Availability Zones are still available to route traffic. If a client doesn't honor the time-to-live (TTL) and sends requests to the IP address after it is removed from DNS, the requests fail.   For TCP traffic, the load balancer selects a target using a flow hash algorithm based on the protocol, source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and TCP sequence number. The TCP connections from a client have different source ports and sequence numbers, and can be routed to different targets. Each individual TCP connection is routed to a single target for the life of the connection.   For UDP traffic, the load balancer selects a target using a flow hash algorithm based on the protocol, source IP address, source port, destination IP address, and destination port. A UDP flow has the same source and destination, so it is consistently routed to a single target throughout its lifetime. Different UDP flows have different source IP addresses and ports, so they can be routed to different targets.   An Auto Scaling group contains a collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management. An Auto Scaling group also enables you to use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling features such as health check replacements and scaling policies. Both maintaining the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group and automatic scaling are the core functionality of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service.   The size of an Auto Scaling group depends on the number of instances that you set as the desired capacity. You can adjust its size to meet demand, either manually or by using automatic scaling.   An Auto Scaling group starts by launching enough instances to meet its desired capacity. It maintains this number of instances by performing periodic health checks on the instances in the group. The Auto Scaling group continues to maintain a fixed number of instances even if an instance becomes unhealthy. If an instance becomes unhealthy, the group terminates the unhealthy instance and launches another instance to replace it.

That is, you can create a snapshot of your DB instance, and then create an encrypted copy of that snapshot. You can then restore a DB instance from the encrypted snapshot, and thus you have an encrypted copy of your original DB instance.   DB instances that are encrypted can't be modified to disable encryption.   You can't have an encrypted read replica of an unencrypted DB instance or an unencrypted read replica of an encrypted DB instance.   Encrypted read replicas must be encrypted with the same key as the source DB instance when both are in the same AWS Region.   You can't restore an unencrypted backup or snapshot to an encrypted DB instance.   To copy an encrypted snapshot from one AWS Region to another, you must specify the KMS key identifier of the destination AWS Region. This is because KMS encryption keys are specific to the AWS Region that they are created in.

S3 Intelligent- Tiering is the first cloud object storage class that delivers automatic cost savings by moving data between two access tiers \u2013 frequent access and infrequent access \u2013 when access patterns change, and is ideal for data with unknown or changing access patterns.   S3 Intelligent-Tiering stores objects in two access tiers: one tier that is optimized for frequent access and another lower-cost tier that is optimized for infrequent access. For a small monthly monitoring and automation fee per object, S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors access patterns and moves objects that have not been accessed for 30 consecutive days to the infrequent access tier. There are no retrieval fees in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. If an object in the infrequent access tier is accessed later, it is automatically moved back to the frequent access tier. No additional tiering fees apply when objects are moved between   access tiers within the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. S3 Intelligent- Tiering is designed for 99.9% availability and 99.999999999% durability, and offers the same low latency and high throughput performance of S3 Standard.

Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge   location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.   Using Amazon S3 Buckets for Your Origin   When you use Amazon S3 as an origin for your distribution, you place any objects that you want CloudFront to deliver in an Amazon S3 bucket. You can use any method that is supported by Amazon S3 to get your objects into Amazon S3, for example, the Amazon S3 console or API, or a third-party tool. You can create a hierarchy in your bucket to store the objects, just as you would with any other Amazon S3 bucket.   Using an existing Amazon S3 bucket as your CloudFront origin server doesn't change the bucket in any way; you can still use it as you normally would to store and access Amazon S3 objects at the standard Amazon S3 price. You incur regular Amazon S3 charges for storing the objects in the bucket.

You must use your root AWS account.   Object Versioning   Use Amazon S3 Versioning to keep multiple versions of an object in one bucket. For example, you could store my-image.jpg (version 111111) and my-image.jpg (version 222222) in a single bucket. S3 Versioning protects you from the consequences of unintended overwrites and deletions. You can also use it to archive objects so that you have access to previous versions. You must explicitly enable S3 Versioning on your bucket. By default, S3 Versioning is disabled. Regardless of whether you have enabled Versioning, each object in your bucket has a version ID. If you have not enabled Versioning, Amazon S3 sets the value of the version ID to null. If S3 Versioning is enabled, Amazon S3 assigns a version ID value for the object. This value distinguishes it from other versions of the same key.

You can use them to enforce the permissions you want everyone in your business to follow. Using SCPs, you can give your developers more freedom to manage their own permissions because you know they can only operate within the boundaries you define.   You create and apply SCPs through AWS Organizations. When you create an organization, AWS Organizations automatically creates a root, which forms the parent container for all the accounts in your organization. Inside the root, you can group accounts in your organization into organizational units (OUs) to simplify management of these accounts. You can create multiple OUs within a single organization, and you can create OUs within other OUs to form a hierarchical structure. You can attach SCPs to the organization root, OUs, and individual accounts. SCPs attached to the root and OUs apply to all OUs and accounts inside of them.   SCPs use the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy language; however, they do not grant permissions. SCPs enable you set permission guardrails by defining the maximum available permissions for IAM entities in an account. If a SCP denies an action for an account, none of the entities in the account can take that action, even if their IAM permissions allow them to do so. The guardrails set in SCPs apply to all IAM entities in the account, which include all users, roles, and the account root user.

        "explain": "Explanation: Reserved Instances   Having 50 EC2 RIs provide a discounted hourly rate and an optional capacity reservation for EC2 instances. AWS Billing automatically applies your RI\u2019s discounted rate when attributes of EC2 instance usage match attributes of an active RI.   If an Availability Zone is specified, EC2 reserves capacity matching the attributes of the RI. The capacity reservation of an RI is automatically utilized by running instances matching these attributes.   You can also choose to forego the capacity reservation and purchase an RI that is scoped to a region. RIs that are scoped to a region automatically apply the RI\u2019s discount to instance usage across AZs and instance sizes in a region, making it easier for you to take advantage of the RI\u2019s discounted rate.   On-Demand Instance   On-Demand instances let you pay for compute capacity by the hour or second (minimum of 60 seconds) with no long-term commitments. This frees you from the costs and complexities of planning, purchasing, and maintaining hardware and transforms what are commonly large fixed costs into much smaller variable costs.   The pricing below includes the cost to run private and public AMIs on the specified operating system (\u201cWindows Usage\u201d prices apply to Windows Server 2003 R2, 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2012 R2, 2016, and 2019). Amazon also provides you with additional instances for Amazon EC2 running Microsoft Windows with SQL Server, Amazon EC2 running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Amazon EC2 running Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Amazon EC2 running IBM that are priced differently.   Spot Instances   A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts, you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. The hourly price for a Spot Instance is called a Spot price. The Spot price of each instance type in each Availability Zone is set by Amazon EC2, and adjusted gradually based on the long-term supply of and demand for Spot Instances. Your Spot Instance runs whenever capacity is available and the maximum price per hour for your request exceeds the Spot price.

Currently, AWS Snowball Edge device doesn't support server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C). AWS Snowball Edge device does support server-side encryption with Amazon S3\u2013managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) and server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service \u2013 managed keys (SSE- KMS). For more information, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.   In the US regions, Snowballs come in two sizes: 50 TB and 80 TB. All other regions have the 80 TB Snowballs only. If you're using Snowball to import data, and you need to transfer more data than will fit on a single Snowball, create additional jobs. Each export job can use multiple Snowballs.   The default service limit for the number of Snowballs you can have at one time is 1. If you want to increase your service limit, contact AWS Support.   All objects transferred to the Snowball have their metadata changed. The only metadata that remains the same is filename and filesize. All other metadata is set as in the following example: -rw-rw-r- 1 root root [filesize] Dec 31 1969 [path/filename].   Object lifecycle management   To manage your objects so that they are stored cost effectively throughout their lifecycle, configure their Amazon S3 Lifecycle. An S3 Lifecycle configuration is a set of rules that define actions that Amazon S3 applies to a group of objects. There are two types of actions:   Transition actions \u2013 Define when objects transition to another storage class. For example, you might choose to transition objects to the S3 Standard-IA storage class 30 days after you created them, or archive objects to the S3 Glacier storage class one year after creating them. Expiration actions \u2013 Define when objects expire. Amazon S3 deletes expired objects on your behalf.   The lifecycle expiration costs depend on when you choose to expire objects.

        "explain": "Explanation: Object Versioning   Use Amazon S3 Versioning to keep multiple versions of an object in one bucket. For example, you could store my-image.jpg (version 111111) and my-image.jpg (version 222222) in a single bucket. S3 Versioning protects you from the consequences of unintended overwrites and deletions. You can also use it to archive objects so that you have access to previous versions.   To customize your data retention approach and control storage costs, use object versioning with Object lifecycle management. For information about creating S3 Lifecycle policies using the AWS Management Console, see How Do I Create a Lifecycle Policy for an S3 Bucket? in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide.   If you have an object expiration lifecycle policy in your non-versioned bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy. The noncurrent expiration lifecycle policy will manage the deletes of the noncurrent object versions in the version-enabled bucket. (A version-enabled bucket maintains one current and zero or more noncurrent object versions.)   You must explicitly enable S3 Versioning on your bucket. By default, S3 Versioning is disabled. Regardless of whether you have enabled Versioning, each object in your bucket has a version ID. If you have not enabled Versioning, Amazon S3 sets the value of the version ID to null. If S3 Versioning is enabled, Amazon S3 assigns a version ID value for the object. This value distinguishes it from other versions of the same key.   Enabling and suspending versioning is done at the bucket level. When you enable versioning on an existing bucket, objects that are already stored in the bucket are unchanged. The version IDs (null), contents, and permissions remain the same. After you enable S3 Versioning for a bucket, each object that is added to the bucket gets a version ID, which distinguishes it from other versions of the same key.   Only Amazon S3 generates version IDs, and they can\u2019t be edited. Version IDs are Unicode, UTF-8 encoded, URL-ready, opaque strings that are no more than 1,024 bytes long. The following is an example: 3/L4kqtJlcpXroDTDmJ+rmSpXd3dIbrHY +MTRCxf3vjVBH40Nr8X8gdRQBpUMLUo.   Using MFA delete   If a bucket's versioning configuration is MFA Delete\u2013enabled, the bucket owner must include the x-amz-mfa request header in requests to permanently delete an object version or change the versioning state of the bucket. Requests that include x-amzmfa must use HTTPS. The header's value is the concatenation of your authentication device's serial number, a space, and the authentication code displayed on it. If you do not include this request header, the request fails.

When you create a presigned URL for your object, you must provide your security credentials, specify a bucket name, an object key, specify the HTTP method (GET to download the object) and expiration date and time. The presigned URLs are valid only for the specified duration.   Anyone who receives the presigned URL can then access the object.

        "explain": "Explanation: What Is Amazon CloudFront?   Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.   If the content is already in the edge location with the lowest latency, CloudFront delivers it immediately.   If the content is not in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an origin that you've defined \u2013 such as an Amazon S3 bucket, a MediaPackage channel, or an HTTP server (for example, a web server) that you have identified as the source for the definitive version of your content.   As an example, suppose that you're serving an image from a traditional web server, not from CloudFront. For example, you might serve an image, sunsetphoto.png, using the URL <http://example.com/sunsetphoto.png.>   Your users can easily navigate to this URL and see the image. But they probably don't know that their request was routed from one network to another \u2013 through the complex collection of interconnected networks that comprise the internet \u2013 until the image was found.   CloudFront speeds up the distribution of your content by routing each user request through the AWS backbone network to the edge location that can best serve your content. Typically, this is a CloudFront edge server that provides the fastest delivery to the viewer. Using the AWS network dramatically reduces the number of networks that your users' requests must pass through, which improves performance. Users get lower latency \u2013 the time it takes to load the first byte of the file \u2013 and higher data transfer rates.   You also get increased reliability and availability because copies of your files (also known as objects) are now held (or cached) in multiple edge locations around the world.

Get started with SQS in minutes using the AWS console, Command Line Interface or SDK of your choice, and three simple commands.   SQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent.   Scaling Based on Amazon SQS   There are some scenarios where you might think about scaling in response to activity in an Amazon SQS queue. For example, suppose that you have a web app that lets users upload images and use them online. In this scenario, each image requires resizing and encoding before it can be published. The app runs on EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group, and it's configured to handle your typical upload rates. Unhealthy instances are terminated and replaced to maintain current instance levels at all times. The app places the raw bitmap data of the images in an SQS queue for processing. It processes the images and then publishes the processed images where they can be viewed by users. The architecture for this scenario works well if the number of image uploads doesn't vary over time. But if the number of uploads changes over time, you might consider using dynamic scaling to scale the capacity of your Auto Scaling group.
